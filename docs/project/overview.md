# Project Overview

[← Back to Main Page](../index.md)

## Context

**Ecolink** is an environmental awareness initiative focused on promoting proper waste separation and recycling, especially within the university environment. Through a mobile app and smart collection stations — called **Ecopoints** — the project aims to encourage students to properly clean and sort recyclable materials, primarily aluminum cans and PET bottles.

Currently, only around 39% of the recyclable waste in the Federal District is actually recycled. Ecolink seeks to help improve this statistic by combining **technology, gamification, and educational content**. The app will allow users to locate Ecopoints, register their recyclable donations, track their activity, and earn academic credits through an incentive system. Additionally, the project will leverage social media platforms such as Instagram and TikTok to share informative and engaging content created in collaboration with local waste pickers.

## Objectives and Scope

### Objectives

- Increase the qualified recycling rate in the Federal District.
- Educate users on proper waste sanitation and separation practices.
- Engage University of Brasília (UnB) students through gamification and academic incentives.
- Develop an intuitive app with Ecopoint location services, user history, and deposit tracking.
- Build working prototypes of smart Ecopoints capable of identifying different recyclable materials.
- Produce and publish educational content in partnership with waste pickers on social media platforms.

### Scope

**Included:**

- Mobile application with areas for users and employees.
- Functionality to register drop-offs and track user activity.
- Integration with UnB's academic credit system.
- Development and prototyping of smart Ecopoints.
- Execution of awareness campaigns via Instagram and TikTok.
- Production of video and visual educational content.

**Not Included:**

- Deployment beyond UnB (in this initial phase).
- Collection of waste materials other than cans and bottles.
- Advanced physical security features for Ecopoints (future consideration).
- Monitoring of external or non-controlled environments.
