# Project Overview

[← Back to Main Page](../index.md)

## Context

**Ecolink** is an integrated environmental platform that combines a mobile application with a network of smart waste collection stations, known as **Ecopoints**. The project is built on the pillars of **technology, gamification, and education** to create a seamless and rewarding recycling experience.

The system is designed to guide users through the entire process: from learning how to correctly separate materials, to locating the nearest smart station, to receiving immediate feedback and incentives for their contributions. The mobile app serves as the user's hub for educational content, activity tracking, and redeeming rewards. A key component of the initiative is its collaborative approach, working alongside local waste picker cooperatives and leveraging social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok to amplify its educational reach and community engagement.

## Problem Statement

The improper disposal of waste represents a significant environmental challenge that undermines sustainability efforts in communities. Currently, there is a widespread lack of effective systems to guide people in proper waste separation, leading to low recycling rates due to contamination of recyclable materials, insufficient awareness about correct waste disposal practices, limited accessibility to proper waste collection points, and no incentive system to encourage sustainable behaviors.

This problem is exacerbated by high consumption patterns and rapid waste generation, where different types of waste (paper, plastic, organic, electronic) are constantly produced without adequate separation mechanisms.

Ecolink addresses these challenges through an integrated technological solution that educates, guides, and incentivizes proper waste disposal practices.

## Objectives and Scope

### Objectives

- Increase the qualified recycling rate in the Federal District.
- Educate users on proper waste sanitation and separation practices.
- Engage University of Brasília (UnB) students through gamification and academic incentives.
- Develop an intuitive app with Ecopoint location services, user history, and deposit tracking.
- Build working prototypes of smart Ecopoints capable of identifying different recyclable materials.
- Produce and publish educational content in partnership with waste pickers on social media platforms.

### Scope

**Included:**

- Mobile application with areas for users and employees.
- Functionality to register drop-offs and track user activity.
- Integration with UnB's academic credit system.
- Development and prototyping of smart Ecopoints.
- Execution of awareness campaigns via Instagram and TikTok.
- Production of video and visual educational content.

**Not Included:**

- Deployment beyond UnB (in this initial phase).
- Collection of waste materials other than cans and bottles.
- Advanced physical security features for Ecopoints (future consideration).
- Monitoring of external or non-controlled environments.
