## Guide to Reviewing This Documentation

This document outlines the **functional and non-functional requirements** for **Ecolink**, which integrates **a hardware-connected scale, an API, and a mobile application**. The documentation follows a structured approach to ensure clarity and completeness.

### **How to Use This Documentation**

- **Functional Requirements (FR-00)** – Key capabilities the system must implement.
- **Non-Functional Requirements (NFR-00)** – Quality attributes ensuring system performance, security, and usability.
- **Themes (TM-00)** – High-level system areas grouping functionalities.
- **Epics (EP-00)** – Major features that contribute to the system’s development.
- **Capabilities (C-00)** – The abilities the system must support.
- **Features (F-00)** – Specific technical functionalities fulfilling each capability.
- **User Stories (US-00)** – Individual use cases defining how users interact with the system.
- **Backlog** – A detailed, structured representation of all functionalities (to be built once all topics are mapped).

Each section follows a progressive breakdown of the system’s structure, from high-level requirements to detailed functionalities.  
Nothing in this document is final; please suggest corrections or improvements.

## **5. Capabilities**

> **Capabilities** describe the system's **technical abilities** that support key functionalities.

| #    | Capability         | Description                                   |
| ---- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| C-00 | [Capability Name]  | [Description of system’s technical ability]   |

---

## **6. Features**

> **Features** define the **specific functionalities** to implement each capability.

| #    | Feature             | Description                                          |
| ---- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| F-00 | [Feature Name]      | [Detailed description of the required functionality] |

---

## **7. User Stories**

> **User stories** describe how users interact with the system in real-world scenarios.

| #     | Description                                                              |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| US-00 | As a [user type], I want [action] so that [benefit or purpose].          |

## **8. Backlog**

The project backlog is a structured list of all tasks, features, and improvements planned. It guides development priorities and serves as the foundation for MVP scope selection.

| Theme | Epic   | Capabilities | Features | User Story | Description                                                    |
