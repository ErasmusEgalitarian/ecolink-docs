# Project Objectives

## 1. Overview

[← Back to the Main Page](../../index.md)

The primary objective of the **Ecolink project** is to promote recycling awareness and sustainable practices in the Federal District through a hybrid technological and social approach. This includes the development of an educational app integrated with smart EcoPoint containers and a gamified incentive system for university students. By combining content co-created with waste pickers and interactive tools, Ecolink aims to increase qualified recyclable collection, reduce contamination, and strengthen the circular economy.
