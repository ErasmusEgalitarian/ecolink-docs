## Vision Statement

**Ecolink** envisions a future where recycling and environmental responsibility are seamlessly integrated into daily life through education, technology, and community engagement. Our mission is to revolutionize waste management in the Federal District by promoting proper waste separation and hygiene, increasing the value and volume of recyclable materials, and fostering a culture of sustainability.

Through a mobile application co-created by waste pickers and students from the University of Brasília (UnB), Ecolink will deliver engaging, educational content that empowers users to adopt responsible recycling behaviors. The platform will also introduce gamification, enabling UnB students to earn academic credits by contributing to recycling efforts, thereby reinforcing sustainable practices through tangible incentives.

Our smart collection containers EcoPoints will enable efficient and traceable waste collection. These EcoPoints will be strategically deployed and integrated with the app, allowing users to locate the nearest drop-off locations, track their contributions, and view their environmental impact.

By combining education, technology, social inclusion, and environmental action, Ecolink aims to strengthen the circular economy, support cooperative income, and elevate public awareness about sustainability.
