Issue Identification Identify and document issues that may impact the project. - Record issues as they arise during development, testing, or post-launch.  - Classify issues by severity, impact, and urgency.  - Capture detailed descriptions, steps to reproduce, and any relevant screenshots or logs. 2. Issue Prioritization Assign priority levels to each issue based on its impact on the project. -Critical : Must be resolved immediately to prevent system failure.  - High : Needs urgent attention to avoid major disruptions.  - Medium : Important but does not affect critical functionalities.  - Low : Minor impact, can be addressed later. 3. Issue Assignment Assign issues to the appropriate team members for resolution. - Allocate issues based on team member expertise and workload.  - Set clear expectations on resolution deadlines and outcomes.  - Provide necessary resources or information for issue resolution. 4. Issue Resolution Resolve issues by implementing fixes or workarounds. - Address root causes of issues to prevent recurrence.  - Implement solutions and verify that the issue is fixed.  - Test thoroughly to ensure that the fix does not introduce new problems. 5. Verification and Closure Verify that resolved issues meet the defined acceptance criteria and close them. - Review the resolution with stakeholders and the team.  - Confirm that the issue no longer affects the project or product.  - Close the issue once it\u2019s resolved and communicate the outcome. 6. Documentation and Reporting Maintain a record of issues, resolutions, and lessons learned. - Update the issue tracking system with detailed information on each issue.  - Generate reports on issues, resolutions, and ongoing challenges.  - Use issue tracking data for continuous improvement and future project planning."},{"location":"project/management/issue-tracking/#revision-history","title":"Revision History","text":"Date Version Changes Authors 2025-03-28 0.1 Document creation Cain\u00e3 Freitas and Lucas Antunes <p>\u2190 Back to Main Page</p>"},{"location":"project/management/lessons-learned/","title":"Lessons Learned","text":"<p>\u2190 Back to Main Page</p> Lesson Action Result 1. Importance of Defining Requirements Clearly Clearly and precisely defining the requirements is essential for the successful execution of the project. Early documentation and stakeholder involvement are key. Constant scope changes caused rework and delays. A deeper analysis at the beginning could have saved time and resources. 2. The Importance of Automated Testing The adoption of automated testing was a positive change to improve system reliability and maintenance. Implementing automated tests ensures that changes do not break existing functionality, saving time in the long run. 3. Dependency and Update Management Use version control tools like <code>npm</code>to manage external dependencies and ensure compatibility across all system versions. By managing dependencies and versions effectively, compatibility issues were avoided and stability was ensured. 4. Communication Between Team and Stakeholders Establish regular feedback meetings to ensure all stakeholders are aligned on project goals and deliverables. Improved transparency, aligned expectations, and the ability to adjust priorities based on continuous feedback. 5. The Value of Adequate Documentation Properly document each step of the development process, including system architecture, workflows, and API details. Well-organized documentation made deployment and future updates faster and less prone to errors, facilitating new team member training. 6. Scalability Planning Implement scalability practices such as microservices and load balancing from the start to accommodate growth. The system\u2019s scalability improved, supporting more users and data without sacrificing performance. 7. The Importance of Continuous Integration and Automated Deployment Implement CI/CD pipelines for frequent integration and automation of deployments to ensure faster releases and error identification. Continuous integration and automated delivery reduced production errors and improved team efficiency. 8. Challenges with Subscription Management and Payment Processing Conduct detailed analysis, select payment providers carefully, and implement load testing and payment simulations. Payment and subscription management became more efficient and stable, improving the user experience and system reliability."},{"location":"project/management/lessons-learned/#revision-history","title":"Revision History","text":"Date Version Changes Authors 2025-03-28 0.1 Document creation Cain\u00e3 Freitas and Lucas Antunes <p>\u2190 Back to Main Page</p>"},{"location":"project/management/meetings/","title":"Schedule","text":""},{"location":"project/management/meetings/#sprint-planning-ecolink","title":"\ud83d\udcc5 Sprint Planning \u2014 Ecolink","text":"<p>Final delivery: June 17, 2025 Each sprint lasts 14 days</p> Sprint Goals Deliverables Start Date End Date SPRINT 0 - Define frontend and backend responsibilities  - Set up communication tools  - Study current repository and map existing infrastructure  - Identify initial technical dependencies Team alignment document  Initial technical mapping 2025-03-24 2025-04-06 SPRINT 1 - Gather requirements for EcoPoints and CMS  - Analyze existing APIs and dependencies  - Start building the backlog Requirements document  Technical dependencies report 2025-04-07 2025-04-20 SPRINT 2 - Finalize detailed requirements and acceptance criteria  - Prioritize and structure the backlog  - Start API and static map prototype Prioritized backlog  Initial EcoPoints prototype 2025-04-21 2025-05-04 SPRINT 3 - Complete EcoPoints module (filters, location, tests)  - Start CMS with CRUD structure and user roles Functional EcoPoints module  CMS prototype (CRUD + roles) 2025-05-05 2025-05-18 SPRINT 4 - Finalize CMS features (editing, validation)  - General testing and polish  - Draft technical and user documentation Fully functional CMS  Initial documentation 2025-05-19 2025-06-01 SPRINT 5 - Final testing, bug fixes, stakeholder validation  - UX adjustments and official delivery Final validated system  Final documentation  Delivery 2025-06-02 2025-06-17"},{"location":"project/management/meetings/#planned-meetings","title":"\ud83d\udcc6 Planned Meetings","text":"Meeting Date Participants Purpose Sprint 0 \u2013 Kickoff 2025-03-24 Dev Team + PM Initial alignment and technical structuring Sprint 0 \u2013 Follow-up 2025-03-31 Dev Team + PM Review studies and stack mapping Sprint 1 \u2013 Planning 2025-04-07 Dev Team + PM Start requirements gathering and API analysis Sprint 1 \u2013 Follow-up 2025-04-14 Dev Team + PM Validate technical dependencies and domain understanding Sprint 2 \u2013 Planning 2025-04-21 Dev Team + PM Consolidate backlog and start technical development Sprint 2 \u2013 Follow-up 2025-04-28 Dev Team + PM Check progress on EcoPoints module Sprint 3 \u2013 CMS Kickoff 2025-05-05 Dev Team + PM Review EcoPoints completion and start CMS Sprint 3 \u2013 Follow-up 2025-05-12 Dev Team + PM Validate filters integration and CMS structure Sprint 4 \u2013 CMS Finalization 2025-05-19 Dev Team + PM Finalize features and testing Sprint 4 \u2013 Follow-up 2025-05-26 Dev Team + PM Review documentation and final integration Sprint 5 \u2013 Final Delivery Check 2025-06-10 Dev Team + PM + Stakeholders Validate final product with stakeholders Sprint 5 \u2013 Wrap-up 2025-06-17 Dev Team + PM Final presentation, delivery and retrospective"},{"location":"project/management/meetings/#revision-history","title":"Revision History","text":"Date Version Changes Authors 2024-03-28 0.1 Document creation Cain\u00e3 Freitas, Lucas Antunes 2025-04-06 0.2 Updated document with Ecolink scope and timeline Mateus Vieira 2025-04-08 0.3 Adjusted for 14-day sprints and final deadline Mateus Vieira"},{"location":"project/management/roadmap/","title":"Project Roadmap","text":"<p>\u2190 Back to Main Page</p>"},{"location":"project/management/roadmap/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>This roadmap aligns with Ecolink\u2019s 14\u2011day cadence, culminating in final delivery on June\u00a017,\u00a02025.
