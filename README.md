# EgalitarianProject

## Carbon Footprint
A base prototype of an application to reduce waste on the streets.
Make it accessible for locals and cooperatives in Bras√≠lia to register their waste for pick-up.

## Installation
Most likely I will be using Docker to deploy the application.
Further changes will make this README.md update...

## Roadmap
